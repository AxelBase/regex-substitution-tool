This tool fixes that problem permanently by making these anchors work exactly where they belong — on every single line.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">The Old Way: One Match at the Top</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">In standard regex testers, the caret symbol matches only the position before the very first character of the entire input. Even with the multiline flag enabled in some engines, JavaScript’s native RegExp does not support this flag. The result? Your pattern targeting start of line error only affects the first line containing that text, if any.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">The Correct Way: Every Line Is First</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">With line-by-line processing, every line becomes its own universe. When the tool applies your regex to a line, that line is treated as a complete string. The caret now matches the true beginning of that line, and the dollar matches its true end. No flags needed. No workarounds required.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Practical Examples That Just Work</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Want to remove empty lines? Use start of line followed by end of line. Want to trim whitespace from the beginning of each log entry? Use caret followed by whitespace. Want to add a prefix only to lines containing a specific word? Combine caret with your condition. All of these patterns work perfectly on every line.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">No More Multiline Flag Confusion</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Many developers try to enable the multiline flag to fix anchor behavior, only to discover JavaScript ignores it completely. This tool eliminates that confusion entirely. You write patterns the way you think about them — line by line.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Consistency Across All Data Types</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Whether you’re cleaning web server logs, test runner output, CSV files, or JSON Lines data, you can rely on the same anchor behavior every time. This consistency is what experienced testers depend on when automating data preparation tasks.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Write Patterns With Confidence</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Once you internalize that caret and dollar always mean start and end of the current line, your pattern-writing becomes faster, safer, and more intuitive. No more testing on single lines and hoping it scales.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">This fundamental improvement is why so many testers keep this tool bookmarked.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">Next: How capturing groups and backreferences stay perfectly isolated.</p></article></div>');function C(h){var e=T();u("1al8b51",m=>{var s=x(),f=y(b(s),6);t(4),r(()=>i(f,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),v(()=>{g.title="Mastering Start and End of Line Anchors | Regex Tool Blog"}),n(m,s)});var a=o(e),d=o(a);t(4),l(a),t(2),l(e),r(()=>i(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),n(h,e)}export{C as component,A as universal};
