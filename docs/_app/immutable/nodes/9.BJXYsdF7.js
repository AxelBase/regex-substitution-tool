Replacing only the first occurrence per line is not a limitation — it’s a feature that prevents over-matching and accidental data loss.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Protecting Structured Data</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">When cleaning JSON Lines or CSV data, you often want to replace a specific field once per record. Using global replacement risks touching quoted values elsewhere in the same line. Omitting the g flag ensures only the intended match is transformed.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Avoiding Greedy Surprises</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Patterns using dot-star or plus can become unexpectedly greedy across a line. Without the global flag, only the first — and usually the correct — section is replaced, giving you precise control.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Real Tester Example: Masking Passwords</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">When redacting credentials from test logs, you want exactly one replacement per line where the password appears. A global pattern might replace harmless strings that happen to match the same pattern later in the line. No global flag equals no risk.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Intentional Design Wins</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Experienced testers treat the absence of the global flag as a deliberate choice, not a mistake. It signals: replace only what I meant to replace, nothing more. This mindset produces more maintainable and reviewable transformations.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Next time you reach for the g flag out of habit — pause and ask whether first-match-per-line is actually the safer default. In most testing workflows, it is.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">Next: How this tool processes massive inputs instantly — all in your browser.</p></article></div>');function P(h){var e=x();y("1li990r",m=>{var s=_(),d=u(f(s),6);t(4),r(()=>n(d,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),v(()=>{b.title="When NOT to Use the Global (g) Flag | Regex Tool Blog"}),l(m,s)});var a=i(e),g=i(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),r(()=>n(g,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),l(h,e)}export{P as component,S as universal};
